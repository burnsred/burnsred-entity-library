/**
 * Lightness (50%+): Add tint
 * Lightness (50%-): Add shade
 * Saturation (100%-): gradient to gray
 */

/** Complementary (2 - 180 degrees apart)
 * Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel are considered to be complementary colors (example: red and green).
 * The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation. This color scheme must be managed well so it is not jarring.
 * Complementary colors are tricky to use in large doses, but work well when you want something to stand out.
 * Complementary colors are really bad for text.
 */

/** Triad (3 - 60 degrees apart)
 * A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.
 * Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.
 * To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.
 */

/** Analogous (3 - 30 degrees on each side)
 * Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs.
 * Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.
 * Make sure you have enough contrast when choosing an analogous color scheme.
 * Choose one color to dominate, a second to support. The third color is used (along with black, white or gray) as an accent.
 */

/** Split-Complementary (3 - 150 degrees on each side)
 * The split-complementary color scheme is a variation of the complementary color scheme. In addition to the base color, it uses the two colors adjacent to its complement.
 * This color scheme has the same strong visual contrast as the complementary color scheme, but has less tension.
 * The split-complimentary color scheme is often a good choice for beginners, because it is difficult to mess up.
 */

/** Rectangle (4 - 60/120 alternate degrees apart to form a rectangle)
 * The rectangle or tetradic color scheme uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs.
 * This rich color scheme offers plenty of possibilities for variation.
 * The tetradic color scheme works best if you let one color be dominant.
 * You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.
 */

/** Square (4 - 90 degrees apart)
 * The square color scheme is similar to the rectangle, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle.
 * The square color scheme works best if you let one color be dominant.
 * You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.
